<b>Colombia is on a trajectory to become a hub of AI in Latin America. AI is still in its infancy. Although Silicon Valley and Beijing are currently leading the
way in AI, with the UK and Canada also emerging as innovation hubs, there are still opportunities for every major country. Colombia has been making smart
moves building up its tech ecosystem.
For example, earlier this month, the Colombian Ministry of IT and Communications launched a program to train 4,413 students in machine learning, Python,
deep learning and other AI subjects. The World Economic Forum has also opened its first Latin American Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in
Medellín to identify and update public policies for AI and other emerging technologies.
I am proud to bet on Colombia and support the growth of the Colombian and the broader Latin American AI community. Ensuring access to education,
expertise and opportunity remains core to my mission. We are able to share our AI ecosystem and Silicon Valley know-how with Medellín; we’re equally
thrilled for our Silicon Valley team to be learning from the Medellín community. Local knowledge and innovation shared with a global community is what will
catapult the technology forward.I hope that our work in Colombia will also serve as a model for other regions with emerging AI hubs.
